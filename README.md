# Nexus Future Fund Website

This repository contains the official website for [Nexus Future Fund](https://nexus-future-fund-website.vercel.app), a trusted mutual fund investment platform offering secure and high-performing financial opportunities. The website is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), a powerful framework for production-grade React applications.

## Getting Started

To contribute or make changes to the website, follow the steps below to set up your local development environment.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (version 14.x or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server, run one of the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Once the server is running, open [https://nexusfuturefund.vercel.app](https://nexusfuturefund.vercel.app) in your browser to see the website in action.

As you make changes to the code, the browser will automatically reload to reflect the updates.

### Modifying the Website

The website's entry point is located at `app/page.tsx`. You can modify this file or add new components within the `app` directory to extend or update the website.

The project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to optimize and load custom fonts like [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), providing a modern and seamless typography experience.
