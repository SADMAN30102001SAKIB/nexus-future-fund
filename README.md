# Webapp For my Investment Firm

Nexus Future Fund is a cutting-edge, crypto-based hedge fund platform designed to deliver high monthly return of investment through risk-managed, algorithmic trading. I led the full-stack development of the platform, which combines Next.js, Appwrite, and a custom `internal` trade automation system to provide a secure, transparent, and high-performing investment experience.

## Key features include:
✅ Secure user dashboards with wallet tracking, performance analytics etc.
✅ Full PWA support with installability and offline capabilities.
✅ Appwrite-based backend for auth and DB.
✅ Multi-tiered route system for blogs, guides, policies, and onboarding flow.
✅ Real-time trade replication for 50+ MT5 slave accounts. (private codebase)
✅ Enterprise-grade code structuring, versioning, and environment isolation.

### This project not only addresses retail investor pain points around crypto volatility, but also sets a new benchmark in crypto fund transparency and reliability.
